## Customer Repurchase Prediction

### Project Overview
Develop a classification model to predict customers likely to repurchase a car based on past purchases and various features such as car type, servicing details, and more.

### Value Proposition
The model provides insights into customer behavior, enabling targeted marketing to increase campaign efficiency and boost repurchase rates.

### Goals
1. Predict potential car repurchase customers using classification models.
2. Evaluate models based on F1 score.
   
Tools: Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, altair, scikit-learn.

### Modelling
1. Part A: Trained Support Vector Classifier.
2. Part B: Trained K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier.
3. Part C: Trained Decision Tree Classifier.
4. Part D: Trained Random Forest Classifier.
5. Part E: Trained Random Forest with Automated Hyperparameter Tuning.
